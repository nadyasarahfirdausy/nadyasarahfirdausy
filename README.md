Hollaaa 👋

✨Nadya is heree✨
hello, I'm Nadya Sarah Firdausy
Undergraduate Student at  Geophysic UGM.

In Geophysics, I deepen my passion and skills in exploring the Earth,
while also refining my programming abilities as a valuable tool for processing data and understanding geophysical phenomena.

Beyond academics, I enjoy writing daily journals and continuously seeking new knowledge to enrich my learning journey.🧚‍♀🪐📓
